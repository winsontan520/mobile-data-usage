## Intro
Project created and built using IDE Android Studio 3.5.3

Based on Android Clean Architecture as proposed by [Philippe BOISNEY](https://proandroiddev.com/android-architecture-d7405db1361c)
with modification into single project instead multiple modules.

## Design Pattern: 
- MVVM with databinding
- Dependency Injection using Koin 2.0
- Network using Retrofit and Kotlin Coroutines
- AndroidX and Navigation component
- Unit Testing using Mockk

## Test Coverage
To run test coverage:  
``./gradlew connectedAndroidTest jacocoTestReport``

Then can find the report at <project>/app/build/reports/coverage/debug/index.html
